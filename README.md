1.even against possible insider attacks – that votes are cast as intended, recorded as cast and counted as recorded.

2.the common functions in
elections and maintenance of electoral rolls using Blockchain may be an overkill and a simpler implementation of a public bulletin board will suffice.

3.it is practically almost impossible to make large-scale internet voting – with votes cast from
people’s homes and other private places – coercion free

4.It is impossible to assume that a general voter will have access to a device or an app that can be trusted to carry out the necessary voting tasks – for example, encrypting the vote and casting it over the internet – securely and privately. This is commonly known as the ‘secure platform problem’ (Rivest, 2001).A voter may own electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops and other computers, but is seldom
aware of their internal functioning or is in full control of the underlying hardware, operating system or the application. In most situations there is no way for a voter to ensure that a genuine untampered version is
running.
